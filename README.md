### Own feedback

This has given me a little more OO PHP practice. It was quite a handy project to create, because of the forking possibilities. For example, it could be extended to make complete questionnaires. 

The initial planning at the data level of this project was poor, so to do something like a complete questionnaire, I would probably do a rewrite with a data set covering a broader set of use cases.
